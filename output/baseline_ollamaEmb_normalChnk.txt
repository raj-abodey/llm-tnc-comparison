4. **Popular Near Me Feature**: 
    – Collects anonymous usage data related to App Store products when Location Services are enabled by the user.


### Summary of Key Differences:

#### Impact on Auto-downloads/Content Management
- The first document focuses heavily on managing downloaded content across multiple devices under strict association rules which limit device switching frequency and number of associated devices per account ((Clauses i)-(iv)). This impacts how users manage their media libraries across different platforms significantly more than what is discussed in Document 2 regarding app-related purchases/subscriptions without such stringent device management rules.

#### Subscription Services
- Both documents discuss subscription services but differ in scope; Document 1 covers "iTunes Match" which deals specifically with music libraries while Document 2 discusses broader "In-App Subscriptions" applicable within various apps including automatic renewal policies along with free trial periods impacting how users manage ongoing costs differently based upon service type subscribed ((Document ID:465e6144-d568...).

#### Privacy Considerations
– The second document introduces potential sharing of personal information like name/email/postcode with third-party publishers subjecting users' privacy preferences directly influencing marketing communications received post-consent ((Document ID:465e6144-d568...).

Overall these differences highlight varying degrees affecting user experience primarily around media/content management versus app-specific transactions/subscription handling alongside evolving privacy implications tied into newer functionalities introduced over time between both sets analyzed from respective years provided above
