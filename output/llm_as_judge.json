However, it lacks specific examples or direct quotes from both documents to substantiate these points fully. Additionally, some other significant changes might have been overlooked or not highlighted in enough detail.\nTotal rating: 3",
    "./output/baseline_openaiEmb_normalChnk.txt": "Feedback:::\nEvaluation: The summary provided captures some of the key points from both documents, but it lacks depth and misses several important details. While it does mention agreement formation, services covered, home country specification, requirements for use, transactions, payment methods, password management & authentication from Document 1 and liability limitations & protections, fraud protection efforts, non-exclusion clauses from Document 2; it fails to address other significant aspects such as Family Sharing rules in Document 1 or the detailed terms related to App Store content in Document 2. Additionally, the summary does not clearly differentiate between the two documents' unique provisions and their specific impacts on users. The impact analysis is also quite general and doesn't delve into how these terms might affect user behavior or decision-making.\n\nTotal rating: 2",
    "./output/baseline_opensourceEmb_normalChnk.txt": "Feedback:::\nEvaluation: The summary provided captures several key differences between the two documents, such as warranty clauses, limitation of liability, consent to use data, termination clauses, export restrictions and compliance with laws, commercial items licensing to US government end users, and governing law. However, it misses some other significant changes and does not fully assess the impact or significance of these changes. For instance:\n\n1. **Warranty Clauses**: The summary correctly identifies that both documents state that the Licensor will use reasonable care but does not make any other warranties about External Services being uninterrupted or free from security issues.\n2. **Limitation of Liability**: The summary accurately outlines the scenarios where Licensor is not liable for loss or damage in both documents.\n3. **Consent to Use Data**: This section appears only in the 2023 document and is well captured in the summary.\n4. **Termination Clauses**: The summary notes that both documents state rights under EULA terminate automatically if users fail compliance with its terms but could have been more explicit about how this clause is stated differently in each version.\n5. **Export Restrictions & Compliance With Laws**: Both versions restrict export/re-exporting licensed applications into U.S.-embargoed countries/to individuals on certain U.S government lists while ensuring compliance with applicable laws including prohibitions against using these products towards developing nuclear/missile/chemical-biological weapons; this was well noted.\n6 .**Commercial Items Licensing To US Government End Users:** Both versions define licensed applications/documentation as \"Commercial Items\" per relevant C.F.R regulations granting same rights provided all other end-users under these T&Cs while reserving unpublished-rights protected under US copyright laws; this was also captured accurately.\n\nHowever:\n- It lacks a detailed comparison of sections like Family Sharing rules which have seen significant updates over time.\n- It doesn't mention new services introduced (e.g., Apple Fitness+, Apple News+) which are part of 2023 T&Cs but absent from 2015 T&Cs.\n\nOverall it provides a good overview but could be more comprehensive by including additional differences impacting user experience significantly.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "./output/baseline_ollamaEmb_normalChnk.txt": "Feedback:::\nEvaluation: The summary provided captures several key differences between the two documents, such as auto-downloads and associated devices, content availability, Apple TV usage, data charges, iTunes Match service in Document 1 versus in-app purchases and subscriptions, privacy concerns with publishers, and the Popular Near Me feature in Document 2. However, it misses some important aspects like the detailed terms of use for different services (e.g., Apple Music), specific legal disclaimers and liability limitations that are present in both documents but have evolved over time. Additionally, while it mentions privacy considerations briefly for Document 2 regarding sharing user information with publishers upon consent for marketing purposes according to publisher's privacy policy; it does not delve into how these policies have changed or expanded from Document 1 to Document 2.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
