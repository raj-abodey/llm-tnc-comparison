### Key Differences Between 2015 and 2023 Terms and Conditions Documents

#### Export and Re-export Laws
The 2023 terms and conditions for Apple Devices and Licensed Applications in the United States place a significant emphasis on compliance with U.S. export and re-export laws, as well as various federal regulations. This includes specific restrictions imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Treasury Department [Data: Reports (4)]. This focus on export compliance is more pronounced compared to the 2015 terms, which did not highlight these legal requirements to the same extent.

#### Legal Framework and User Rights
The 2023 terms for the iTunes Service include detailed sections on Disclaimer of Warranties, Liability Limitations, and the right to make Changes. These sections are designed to ensure that users are fully aware of their rights and obligations, providing a comprehensive legal framework for the operation of the Service [Data: Reports (12)]. The 2015 terms also included similar sections, but the 2023 version offers more detailed explanations and clearer guidelines.

#### External Services and Third Party Materials
In 2023, the terms for Apple Devices and Licensed Applications include specific provisions for External Services and Third Party Materials. These provisions may vary by country and require compliance with local laws [Data: Reports (4)]. This is an expansion from the 2015 terms, which were less explicit about the variability and local compliance requirements for third-party services and materials.

#### Termination Clauses
The 2023 terms for the iTunes Service include robust Termination clauses that allow iTunes to end the Service or user accounts for non-compliance with the terms. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Service [Data: Reports (12)]. While the 2015 terms also had termination clauses, the 2023 version provides more detailed conditions under which termination may occur.

#### Role of the Licensor
The 2023 terms emphasize the role of the Licensor in providing and managing access to the Licensed Application and External Services, including the enforcement of the Standard End User License Agreement (EULA) [Data: Reports (4)]. This is a more detailed approach compared to the 2015 terms, which did not elaborate as extensively on the responsibilities and enforcement powers of the Licensor.

### Conclusion
The 2023 terms and conditions documents for Apple Devices and Licensed Applications, as well as the iTunes Service, have evolved to include more detailed legal frameworks, a stronger emphasis on compliance with U.S. export laws, and clearer guidelines on the role of the Licensor and termination clauses. These updates reflect a more comprehensive approach to user rights, obligations, and legal compliance compared to the 2015 terms.
