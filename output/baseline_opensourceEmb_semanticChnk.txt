The termination clause is detailed in section c. It states that the Standard EULA is effective until terminated by either you or Licensor. Your rights under this EULA will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with any of its terms.
**Impact:** Users must be vigilant about compliance with all terms to avoid automatic termination of their rights.

No explicit termination clause is mentioned in the provided excerpt.
**Impact:** Lack of a clear termination clause may lead to ambiguity regarding how and when user rights can be terminated.

**2015 Document:**
No mention of External Services in the provided excerpt.
**Impact:** Users do not receive information about potential risks or limitations associated with using external services linked to the licensed application.

#### Warranty:
**2023 Document:**
Section e outlines warranties related specifically to reasonable care for Licensed Applications but disclaims other warranties for External Services. It does not guarantee uninterrupted service or protection against data loss/corruption.
**Impact:** Users should manage expectations regarding service reliability and take responsibility for backing up their data.

**2015 Document:**
No warranty details are included in the provided excerpt.
**Impact:** Absence of warranty information leaves users without guidance on what level of service quality or support they can expect from Licensor.

**2023 Document:**
Section f(i) limits liability except where there is no breach of legal duty by Licensor, unforeseeable results from breaches by users themselves, decisions made during investigations into violations, loss related to income/business/profits/data corruption. Section f(ii) clarifies that nothing limits liability for fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct/death/personal injury caused by negligence.
