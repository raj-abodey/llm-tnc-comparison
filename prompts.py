    Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the system_answer is not helpful at all, and 4 means that the system_answer completely and helpfully addresses the user_question.

    Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
    1: The system_answer is terrible: the differences are not captured and/or missing many differences
    2: The system_answer is mostly not helpful: misses some key differences of the question and is not clearly assessing the impact and significance of the changes
    3: The system_answer is mostly helpful: provides comprehensive list of all differences and highlights the impact and signifcance of the changes. 
    4: The system_answer is excellent: Illustrates all the differences with clear commentary, detailed, relevant, direct and addresses all the impact and the significance of the changes.

    Provide your feedback as follows:

    Feedback:::
    Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
    Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 4)
